## 🎯 About

This is **Phase I** of the "Evolution of Todo" project for **Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development**. The project demonstrates the power of AI-native development where specifications drive implementation, and Claude Code generates all production code.

**Phase I Objective**: Build a functional command-line todo application with in-memory storage, focusing on clean architecture and core CRUD operations.

**Key Principle**: No code was written manually. All implementation was generated by Claude Code based on comprehensive specifications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application follows a **layered architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         MAIN APPLICATION                │
│         (Entry Point & Loop)            │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         CLI LAYER                       │
│    (User Interface & Interaction)       │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         STORAGE LAYER                   │
│    (In-Memory CRUD Operations)          │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         MODELS LAYER                    │
│    (Data Structures & Validation)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Layer Responsibilities

- **Models Layer** (`models.py`): Task data structure with validation
- **Storage Layer** (`storage.py`): In-memory CRUD operations
- **CLI Layer** (`cli.py`): User interface and interaction handling
- **Main Layer** (`main.py`): Application entry point and initialization

### Design Principles

✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each layer has one clear purpose  
✅ **Separation of Concerns** - UI, logic, and data are separate  
✅ **Loose Coupling** - Easy to swap implementations  
✅ **High Cohesion** - Related functionality grouped together  
✅ **Extensibility** - Ready for Phase II database integration

## 📝 Spec-Driven Development

This project follows a **strict spec-driven development approach**:

### Development Workflow

```
Constitution → Specs → Plan → Tasks → Implement
```

### Key Principles

1. **No Code Without Specs**: Every feature has a specification before implementation
2. **AI-Generated Code**: All code generated by Claude Code, no manual coding
3. **Spec Refinement**: If code is wrong, update the spec and regenerate
4. **Phase Boundaries**: No features from future phases leak into Phase I

### Specification Files

All specifications are documented in the `/specs` folder:

- **Constitution**: Project rules and constraints
- **Overview**: Project scope and goals
- **Architecture**: System design and layers
- **Task Model**: Data structure and validation rules
- **CLI Interface**: User interface design
- **Features**: Individual feature specifications

### Claude Code Instructions

See `CLAUDE.md` for instructions on how Claude Code was used to generate this project.

## 📝 Notes

### Important Points

- All data is stored **in-memory** only (not persistent between sessions)
- This is **Phase I** of a 5-phase evolution project
- Code was **100% generated** by Claude Code following specifications
- Ready for **Phase II expansion** with database and web interface

### Known Limitations

- ⚠️ Data is lost when application exits (by design for Phase I)
- ⚠️ No concurrent user support (single-user application)
- ⚠️ No file-based persistence
- ⚠️ No search or filter functionality (Phase V feature)

### Future Improvements

These features will be added in future phases:
- Persistent storage (Phase II)
- Web interface (Phase II)
- AI chatbot (Phase III)
- Cloud deployment (Phase IV-V)
- Advanced features (Phase V)
